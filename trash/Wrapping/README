Code to generate the Python Wrappers to use Statismo with VTK or ITK from Python. Note that this requires that VTK and ITK have been compiled with Python support enabled. 

*The wrappers are experimental and may not work on your system. Furthermore, they may not be supported in future version of statismo.*
