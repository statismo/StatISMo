/**
 * \brief Representation of a linear statistical model (PCA Model).
 *
 * The statistical model class represents a statistical (PCA based) model.
 * The implementation is based on the Probabilistic PCA, which includes the Standard PCA as a special case.
 *
 * Mathematically, the statistical model is a generative model, where a sample is given as a linear combination
 * of a \f$n\f$ dimensional latent variable \f$ \alpha \f$ plus additive gaussian noise.
 * \f[ S = \mu + W \alpha + \epsilon. \f]
 * Here, \f$ \mu \in \mathbf{R}^p \f$ is the mean, \f$W \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times n}\f$ is a linear mapping,
 * \f$\alpha \in \mathbf{R}^n \f$ is a vector of latent variables (later also referred to as coefficients)
 * and \f$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\f$ is a noise component.
 * The linear mapping \f$ W \f$ is referred to as the PCABasis. It is usually given as \f$W = U D \f$ where \f$U\f$ where
 * U is an orthonormal matrix and \f$D\f$ is a scaling matrix, referred to as PCAvariance.
 * Usually, \f$U \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times n}\f$ is the matrix of eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix and
 * \f$D\f$ the corresponding eigenvalues.
 *
 * While all the matrices and vectors defined above could be obtained directly, the main goal of this class
 * is to abstract from these technicalities, by providing a high level interface to shape models.
 * In this high level view, the model represents a multivariate normal distribution over the types defined by the representer
 * (which are typically either, surface meshes, point clouds, deformation fields or images).
 * This class provides the method to sample from this probability distribution, and to compute the probability
 * of given samples directly.
 *
