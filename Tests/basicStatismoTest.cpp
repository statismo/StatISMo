 * saved to disk. If the test runs correctly, it merely means that statismo has been setup correclty and hdf5
 * works.

 * Real unit tests that test the functionality of statismo are provided in the statismoTests directory (these tests
 * require VTK to be installed and the statismo python wrapping to be working).
